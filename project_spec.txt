.EXECUTIVE DESCRIPTION
...Make a website that allows users to login, select a series of configurations, and create a django website based on the configurations.

.OVERVIEW
...The primary website should have a series of radio buttons to control the resulting website. They would then be able to view the website they’ve created. On the server, the folder would be copied over, and a python program would find and replace configuration values based on the user’s choice. The user’s choices would also be saved in the database.
